# Example Script for Beamforming
This MATLAB script (beamforming_test.m) takes a set of MEG data and analyzes source locations. There are also images here ("source_noise_biased.png" and "source_neural_activity_index.png") which are the anticipated outputs from this script, before and after noise correction relatively.

## Required Data:
The data for which this script was written in mind (MEG data) can be found at the following ftp server, courtesy of the FieldTrip teams:
